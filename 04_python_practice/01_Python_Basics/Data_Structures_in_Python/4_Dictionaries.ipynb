    "Dictionaries make it easy to store key-value relationships in a single data structure. They are also designed for easy value retrieval (thing about the capital retrieval with a list versus a dictionary). What are the restrictions on things you can put in a dictionary? As for the values, like in lists, there are none! But in terms of the keys those values are associated with, that's a different story.\n",

    "Python dictionaries are an implementation of what's known as a *hash map* or *hash table* ([here's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) the wikipedia page for them if you want to learn more). This computer science idea is basically a function that relates any input, in our case the keys, to a location in memory. Thus, retrieval of a value from a dictionary is entirely dependent on the key. The consequence of this is that, if we were to use a mutable type as the key for a dictionary and later change what that key looked like by mutating it, the dictionary wouldn't be able to find the value it was supposed to associate with that key (since the key has now changed). Let's take a gander at what this type of incorrect usage would look like, but know that the code below will **not** run.\n"
