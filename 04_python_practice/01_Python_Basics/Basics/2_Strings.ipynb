    "First, we are going to learn about another common data type, strings. From a high-level perspective, a string is just a bit of text. This could be text that you have read in from a file, html that you have pulled from the Internet, or any other text. From Python's perspective, a string (type `str`) is simply a collection of encoded characters. Wait, what's an encoding...?\n",
    "\n",
    "An encoding is just a fancy way of us saying that the characters in our string follow a certain format, or structure. The reason this matters to us in terms of our Python programs, though, is that Python expects our strings to be in one of a couple of different encodings (either `ASCII`, `utf-8`, or `unicode`). This isn't something you will run into often, and especially not when defining your own strings (it's probably most prevalent when pulling text from the Internet). However, it's worth noting because there is a good chance that sometime in your Python career, you will end up with Python telling you it doesn't recognize a certain character in one of your strings, and an unexpected encoding will most likely be at the heart of that error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, strings are recognized as a collection of characters surrounded by a set of either single quotation marks (`'...'`) or double quotation marks (`\"...\"`). So long as you open and close your string with a **matching** set of single or double quotation marks, you are free to use either. The single caveat to that is that if you are writing an expression with a single quotation mark in it (such as \"Don't do that\"), you will **have to** use a matching set of **double** quotation marks. Let's experiment with some strings...\n"

As a result, this left `t listen.'` just hanging out, and Python didn't know how to interpret that, resulting in our error.

It turns out there is! One of the methods (a name for a function that is attached to a particular object) that we can call on strings is the `strip()` method. Methods are something that we will cover in much more depth later, but for now just note that we call them on our objects through **dot notation**.

There are a couple of ways to do this, but the first we'll focus on is through indexing. We know that to Python, a string is just a collection of characters. It turns out that we can access the individual characters simply by asking Python for a given numbered element in our collection (i.e. the string).  We do this by placing the element number that we want in square brackets, `[]`,  right after our string (or variable, if it's stored in one).

Also, what are those negative numbers doing? In the case of the former, it turns out that Python (and many programming languages) starts indexing at 0, which means that the first element in our string (and any collection that supports indexing) is accessed via indexing at 0. We refer to languages that work this way as **zero indexed**. As for the negative numbers, this is a way to access elements starting from the end of the string, rather than the beginning.

    "This indexing turns out to be pretty useful. You might notice, though, that when indexing from `[1:3]`, only the letters at index 1 and 2 are returned; when indexing from `[5:9]`, we get the letters at indices 5, 6, 7, and 8. This is because the indices that you pass in are inclusive on the left side, and exclusive on the right side. This means that when you index, you will grab letters from the starting index that you give up to but not including letters at the ending index that you give. \n",

    "What about those last two examples, where there isn't an ending index or a starting one? If you don't give an ending index, then Python assumes that your ending index is the last index in the string. Similarly, if you don't give a starting index, Python assumes that your starting index is the first index in the string. Remember, this is the zeroth index in Python (don't worry if this feels confusing, you'll get used to it quickly).\n",

    "Is there a way to grab elements at regular intervals in a string? For example, what if we wanted to grab every second letter? Python allows us to do this by passing in an optional third number while indexing. This optional third number, also separated by a colon (`:`), tells Python the step size by which to move through the string when indexing. So, if we wanted to grab every second letter from the beginning to end, we could index with `[::2]`. If we wanted to grab every 3rd letter from the letter at index 2 to the letter at index 10, we could use the indexing `[2:10:3]`."

This leaves the concern about when to stop for Python to figure out. With a `for` loop, we don't have to care how many iterations/cycles the loop will go through. Let's look at the syntax of a `for` loop.   \n",

In the case above, since `len(my_str)` is 5, `range(len(my_str))` returns a list of integers from 0 to 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "This `for` loop does the exact same thing as the `while` loop we wrote above, but with slightly different syntax. How does it work? At each iteration of the loop, `idx` is assigned one of the values in `range(len(my_str))`, and then the code within the indented block is run with that value of `idx`. How does Python know what the values of `idx` will be? Python simply goes through the values of whatever is after the `in` statement **in order**, and assigns those values to `idx`, one at a time through each iteration of the loop. Since `range(len(my_str))` returns to us a list of integers from 0 to 4, those values get assigned to `idx` as we run through the `for` loop. Let's look at one of our favorite kinds of tables to view this:\n",

    "Note that with our `for` loop, the `idx` variable is automatically changed, rather than us having to manually update it (like we did in the `while` loop). This is one of the incredibly nice aspects of `for` loops! But wait, it gets even better!\n",

    "What's going on here!? Well, instead of iterating over all of the integers in a `range(len(my_str))` call like we did in our first `for` loop, we've gotten Python to simply iterate over all of the individual characters in our string, `my_str`. In each iteration of this `for` loop, `char` stores a different letter of `my_str`, and then the call `print char` prints that character. In the end, we get the same result as either of our `while` loops above, and the less Pythonic `for` loop that we wrote above. This way is considered to be the Pythonic way to iterate over a string, and so it's an important concept to grasp.\n",

When we say that something is more \"Pythonic\", this means that we are using the language in such a way that makes your code both more readable and simultaneously uses Python's power to make your solutions more optimal. Let's look at how this applies to the final implementation of our `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that it is more readable since we don't have to index into our string anymore. This means that there is less to follow along with and keep track of; rather than keeping track of both the current index we are on and what letter that index corresponds to in our string, all we have to keep track of is the current letter we're on. We can also note that our code just looks cleaner and more simple, too. In terms of making our code more optimal, since we no longer have to index into the string to grab characters, we have fewer steps in each iteration of the loop. This means less work for Python to do.\n",
